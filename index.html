            <p>Welcome to my portfolio page.  I am an aspiring Web Developer currently enrolled in the Trilogy Bootcamp through the University of New Hampshire.  The bootcamp, a 6 month intensive course intended to develop full stack (MERN) developers, encourages us to use all the resources at our disposal to work through our coding problems.  Through utilizing our growing arsenal of tools, we will be able to conquer any coding issue thrown at us.
            </p>
            <p1>When not working on bootcamp a
            activities, I work at Granite State Minerals.  We are a small organization that distributes road salt to the state of New Hampshire, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and numerous municipalities.  Additionally, we sell to independent contractors.  It is seasonal work, with our most directed efforts occuring between October and March each year.  In our pressure filled environment collaboration is key and I am fortunate to work with great people.
            </p1>
            <p2>My most important and rewarding work is with my family.  My husband is an Instructor at UNH in the field of Finance.  Additionally, he is the Director of Online and Part-time MBA programs for UNH.  We have a daughter who is 12 and a son who is 8.  We spend lots of time together exploring our world, enjoying the many recreational activities in New England and cheering on the local sports teams, especially the New England Patriots.
            </p2>
            <p3>In the time left from family, work and bootcamp I am a voracious reader of anything and everything.  I enjoy expanding my mind with non-fiction and the escapism of fiction. I occaisionally engage in spurts of knitting, often resulting in uneven scarves my children humor me by wearing once or twice.  Additionally, I enjoy time with friends and our extended family, often travelling on weekends to Massachusetts, southwest New Hampshire and Virginia.
                  I am truly grateful for all the good in my life.  </p3>
